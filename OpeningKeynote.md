# Evan Czaplicki @czaplic NoRedInk

Even is the Elm BDFL (Benevolent Dictator for Life).

## His Purpose

Evangelize to make the Elm support community larger.

## What I Got Out of It

I've always thought that Elm was one of the most carefully-crafted programming
languages I have ever encountered. In his talk, I discovered an important
reason why: Evan and his team are deliberately slow about fixing issues
(unless they are critical, of course).  The reason is that he can review the
issues, look for patterns and categories and then achieve a proper 50,000 ft
view of the potential solutions.  Frequently many more undiscovered related
issues are swept into the resulting fixes and the overall design is improved.
By delaying, he avoids "pouring concrete" into short-sided improvements that
bog down the future development of the language.

# My Notes

## Summary: 

"Just do a good job" - best advice Evan says he ever got.  Enabled him to 
focus on Elm and not

Alternatives (i.e. competing programming languages) make each community 
stronger.  All learning from each other.  He mentioned this was particularly
 true of Elm and the React community.

Strong emphasis on single source of truth; don't lose sign of your original 
objectives.

# Language Patterns

The Organizational Structure of programming languages; affected by size of 
organization:

* Top Tech Firm
* University
* Startup

## Top Tech Firm

"sacks of money"

* Java
* JS
* Swift
* Go
* Rust

### Goals

* Support a Platform

### Core Team

* Large TEams (6+)

## Universityy

* Haskell
* OCaml
* Scala

### Research and explore

### Core Team

Small TEams (2-4)

## Startup

* Python
* Ruby
* Elm

### Goals

* Nicer way to do X

#### Core Team

* BDFL (Benevolent Dictator for Life)

# Issues

## Are bigger teams better?

Not necessarily; they can lose vision and become subject to political issues.

Elm has some best-in-world language features:

* Most Useful Error Messages
* Fastest React Rendering

Having more people didn't solve these on other languages.

## Development Timelines

Lua vs Elm

Lua after 10 years

Elm after 4 years

### Python

* 1990
* 1995 Guido is primary contributor
* 2000 Python Enhancement Proposals (PEP)


### Elm

* 2012


# What does Collaboration look like?

* Socialize
* Use Elm!

## Socialize

* elm-discuss
* @elmlang
* /r/elm
* Slack

* What are people doing?
* What can I learn from them?
* What problems are being solved?

## Use Elm!

* Something you did in JS before?
* Something you are excited about?
* Learn something new?

## Get Inspired

### Time Travel - Laszlo Pandy 2013

You can look at the history of the changes in your model as your Elm program
 runs:

* Chance
* Passion
* Skill

### John P. Mayer Jr. elm-webgl 2014

Worked w/ Evan to work out through difficulties

## Work

* When do we merge the code?
* Batching work
    * Typical projects
         * issue/fix/release
    * Evan Methodology
         * Batch a bunch of issues
         * See trends and simularities
         * Categorize
         * Come up w/ better simpler more sweeping solutions
         * Can make a coherent set of decisions.
         * Making a platform.
         * Frequent releases are difficult
        
### What You Should Do if you want to support Elm

Say hi on elm-dev!  Communicate about

* What do you want to do?
* Get Feedback!

My personal impression is that they think best results come from 80% 
communicating and 20% coding.

### Design and Draft

* What are all the solutions that exist?
* Which one is the simplest?

### Get Feedback

Here are some projects that have gone through this process:

* elm-webgl
* elm-css
* elm-test
* elm-autocomplete
* elm-style-autormation

### elm-format - Aaron VonderHaar (2016)

### elm-test - Richard Feldman / Max Goldstein (2016)

# What is next for Elm?

* 0.15
* 0.16
* 0.17

## 0.18 -- Debugger

* Shows History
* Can export history
* Can import into later version code and re-run as Q/A process.

## 0.18 -- Code Swapping

## 0.18 -- Server-side rendering

A group of us talked about this with Evan; this has large tough conceptual 
issues.  The server presents a different set of problems from the client.

## 0.18 -- Improve Packaging

## 0.18 -- ???

### Platforms

* Servers
* Mobile
* WebAssembly

### Tools

* Type Suggestions - Compiler will make type suggestions to you.
* REPL

### Misc

* Single-page apps
* HTTP package to be moved into core
* Timely fixes
