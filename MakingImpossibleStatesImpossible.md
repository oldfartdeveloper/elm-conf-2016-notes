# Making Impossible States Impossible - Richard Feldman @rtfeldman

This guy knows how to hit so many "sweet spots" in his presentations.  
Outstanding speaker.

## His Purpose

How getting your record definitions in Elm right is far more important than 
being sloppy and allowing your app to enter impossible states.
  
## What I Got Out of It

Examples of the right way of tracking a "current" member in a list and how 
to hide implementation details in a module.  I internalized the important of
 getting your record/structure definitions right; it can make all the 
 difference is how well your app is going to grow.
 
# My Notes (not very coherent)

## elm-css

DSL in Elm that looks like CSS sort of.

Only generates valid stylesheets.

CSS Spec

* Lots of ways to generate bad CSS.

Testing is good
Impossible is better.

A clearer data model can lead to a clearer API
