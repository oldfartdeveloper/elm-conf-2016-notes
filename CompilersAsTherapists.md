# Compilers as Therapists, or Why Elm is Good for ADHD

Luke Westby - @luke_dot_js

## His Purpose

He talked about how Elm's simpler environment enabled him to focus more on 
the task-at-hand than to go off attempting to fix all the disparate pieces. 
 He asked us to share similar experiences w/ other programmers.

## What I Got Out of It

I agreed w/ his presentation for me: I find that not having to 
understand and organize so 
many Javascript/HTML/CSS/Framework-of-the-week pieces in my head makes my 
concentration so much better.

An aside: with apologies to Forrest, I repeatedly heard attendees say things
 to the effect of "Programming in Elm makes me happy."

## Analogy

Poor eyesight and ADHD

### Poor Vision

* eye strain
* fatigue or headache after you do a close-up task such as reading
* trouble focusing on nearby objects
* blurred vision

You miss out on detals of the physical world.

### ADHD

* mental strain
* fatigue or headache after you do a concentration-intensive task such as reading
* Trouble focusing on current activity
* Blurred mental perception

You miss out on detals of the mental and emotional world.

### fixing vision

Eyeglasses.

### Fixing ADHD

There are tools to focus thoughts.

# Story

Had a cool project that he wanted to do in the browser using react.  Got distracted all over w/ the different
things he encountered.  Result: never built even one feature of his side project.

Then discovered ELm

So many decisions are taken care of for you.  You can concentrate on what you want to do.

# Call to action

* For those with similar stories: share them if you can.
* For those who build things: listen to those stories.
