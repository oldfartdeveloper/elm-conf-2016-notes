# Building an Interactive Storytelling Framework in Elm - Jeff Schomay

He's a developer/artist

## His Purpose

Example of a story-telling generating app and the design choices he 
considered while putting it together.

## What I Got Out of It

I appreciated the description of the effort of defining the business rules 
for what he wanted.  He wanted to use buttons and list selection as much as 
possible over the traditional "adventure game" format of always entering 
text.  He wanted to be sure to give the user not "enough tools" but a 
limited precise set of "right rools" to minimize learning curve and focus on
 the fundemental pieces needed to generate an interesting story.  Gave me 
 new tools to understand writing DSL's in any language; the Elm one was 
 quite appropriate and. 
 
# My Notes

Just listened; didn't take any.
