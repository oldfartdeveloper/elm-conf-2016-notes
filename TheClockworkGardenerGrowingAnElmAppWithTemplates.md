# 07 - The Clockwork Gardener: Growing an Elm App With Templates.md - 
Jessica Kerr

As always, she's an amazing speaker: rapid-fire take-no-prisoners style.

## Her Purpose

Showing off an effort she and a cohort have just gotten to early-alpha: Atom
 editor-based templates for rapidly developing Elm applications.  It's 
 called 'atomist'
 
## What I Got Out of It

Blew me away.  Like Rails, can not only generate Elm apps from scratch, but 
can modify existing Elm code to add features.  Elm is an especially tempting
 target for this kind of abuse because of it's strict type checking and 
 "no-runtime errors" compiler features, Jessica and her partner can rapidly 
 debug the templates.  Awesome idea.
 
# My Notes

If you attempt to take notes during a Jessica presentation, you will be left
 miles behind.  All I could do to "listen fast enough".
