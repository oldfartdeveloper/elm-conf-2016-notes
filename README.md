# elm-conf-2016-notes

These are Scott Smith's (@_ofd - Old Fart Developer) notes and perceptions 
for the very first Elm-lang conference on Sept 15, 2016.

# Overview

This conference's attendees were more excited about Elm than other language 
conferences I've attended in the last 5 years or so.  There is common Elm 
joy because:

* If it compiles, there will be no Elm-caused runtime errors.
* Elm's functional language provides flexible modelling to preclude what 
might be hard to identify logical errors in other languages.
* Exciting things coming down the line vis-a-vis debugging and other "cool" 
features.
* Explanation and celebration of the Elm community's practices.

# My Personal Objectives

* **[Here](PersonalObjectives.md)**.  For those of you who are interested in
 a more personal testamony of what I tried to accomplish at this conference 
 and how well I felt I succeeded.  Hint: I'm an old introvert; I've hated to
  "put myself out there", and this time I wanted to "not do that anymore".

# Sessions

Each page below contains:

* What the presenter's purpose was.
* What I Got out of it
